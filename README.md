Here, I take a programming-interview type exercise and turn it into a more
developed program by adding tests, breaking things up into multiple files, and
of course uploading to Github.

Feedback is welcome in issues, comments, and pull requests here, if you happen
to stumble upon this repository and feel compassion for this budding programmer.

## Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contains a single
digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

Example:

> Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6  -> 4)  
> Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8  
> Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807  

Solution is in `add_two_numbers.py`. To run tests, do:

```
python3 tests.py
```
